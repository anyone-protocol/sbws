   directory authority
        One of the trusted entities in the Tor network. Calculates a consensus
        with the other directory authorities about what relays are running and
        much much more.

   bandwidth authority
        A :term:`directory authority` that measures and votes about Tor relay
        bandwidths. In the context of sbws, it performs measurements with
        :term:`sbws scanner` and creates :term:`v3bw files <v3bw file>`
        periodically with :term:`sbws generate`

   sbws scanner
        The sbws command that a :term:`bandwidth authority` runs continuously
        to gather information about how fast Tor relays are. The results from
        this process are used by :term:`sbws generate` to generate
        :term:`v3bw files <v3bw file>`.

   sbws server
        The sbws command that runs as part of a :term:`helper`. :term:`sbws
        scanners <sbws scanner>` connect to sbws servers to perform measurements.

   helper
        The combination of a :term:`helper relay` and :term:`sbws server`,
        ideally running on the same machine.

   helper relay
        The Tor relay that allows exiting to a nearby :term:`sbws server`. It
        does not need to be a relay with the Exit flag.

   sbws generate
        The sbws command that a :term:`bandwidth authority` runs periodically
        to generate a new :term:`v3bw file` from results gathered by
        :term:`sbws scanner`.

   v3bw file
        The file generated by :term:`sbws generate` that a :term:`bandwidth
        authority` reads to vote about how fast relays are.
