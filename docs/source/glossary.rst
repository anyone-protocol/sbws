   directory authority
        One of the trusted entities in the Tor network. Calculates a consensus
        with the other directory authorities about what relays are running and
        much much more.

   bandwidth authority
        A :term:`directory authority` that measures and votes about Tor relay
        bandwidths. In the context of sbws, it performs measurements with
        :term:`sbws scanner` and creates :term:`v3bw files <v3bw file>`
        periodically with :term:`sbws generate`

   sbws scanner
        The sbws command that a :term:`bandwidth authority` runs continuously
        to gather information about how fast Tor relays are. The results from
        this process are used by :term:`sbws generate` to generate
        :term:`v3bw files <v3bw file>`.

   sbws generate
        The sbws command that a :term:`bandwidth authority` runs periodically
        to generate a new :term:`v3bw file` from results gathered by
        :term:`sbws scanner`.

   v3bw file
        The file generated by :term:`sbws generate` that a :term:`bandwidth
        authority` reads to vote about how fast relays are.
